# TaskPaper Vim ftplugin #

This work started on the work from davidoc. Thanks to him and all contributors!

However, I have heavily modified the project, fixed some bugs, added some
features and also removed some. This is now dependant on python inside of Vim
and assumes that you sync your TaskPaper files with simple text. It is heavily
tailored towards my work flow.

It is therefore not general purpose, but can be easily tailored towards various
styles of usage. I have however not invested a lot to make it useful for
everybody, if there is interest, I might do just that though. For the moment it
is only public so that I can access it from various locations and that friends
can use it as well.
